# Shellock_CTF

Shellock_CTF is a web security-based Capture The Flag (CTF) project designed to enhance understanding of web vulnerabilities and security practices. The project utilizes Node.js and Express for the backend and includes various web security challenges across different topics.

## Features

- **Retro Theme**: The CTF interface sports a retro theme with neon pink and blue color schemes, along with glow effects and animations.
- **Five Challenge Topics**: 
  - Cookie Manipulation
  - Header Manipulation
  - Web Inspection
  - Web Discovery
  - Path Traversal
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Each topic includes five challenges, ranging from easy to hard.

## Current Status

**Note**: The current code is quite messy and not well-structured. This project was initially created to practice my backend knowledge using Node.js and Express. As I continue my journey in web and application security, I'm working on rewriting the entire project with more robust coding practices, utilizing additional technologies, and adding more modules.

## Future Plans

- **Code Refactoring**: Improve the structure and readability of the code.
- **Enhanced Security Challenges**: Integrate more advanced web security topics such as XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypass, Cookie Hijacking, JWT Token Manipulation, OSINT, Steganography, Source Code Manipulation, and Code Review.
- **New Technologies**: Incorporate other backend technologies to expand the project's scope and functionality.
- **Additional Features**: Add progress tracking and flag verification systems.
